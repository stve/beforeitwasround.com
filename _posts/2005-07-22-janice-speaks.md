If you are wondering where I've been the past few days, I was in Minneapolis for Adaptive Path's "Beyond Usability: Designing the Complete User Experience" class.  It was a great two days. If you look at the photo, I'm right in the middle in a blue golf shirt.

My only regret is that I didn't get to spend much time in Minneapolis.  I was there for less than 48 hours total.  Of course, a 3 hour delay in Washington before the trip started didn't help matters.  The event was held at the <a title="The Walker Art Center" href="http://www.walkerartcenter.org">Walker Art Center</a> which is a really cool place.  I wish I had more time to wander around because their exhibits were pretty cool.  It really made me look forward to the Getty and MOMA on our trip next month.

It was really nice to exchange ideas with some <a title="Bryan" href="http://www.b-may.com">really</a> <a title="Morten" href="http://www.genstart.dk">great</a> <a title="Lyle" href="http://crocolyle.blogspot.com">people</a> while I was there.  Working at home, I don't get the opportunity to do that nearly enough.

I can't say enough good things about Adaptive Path.  The training was excellent and I think <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/events/2005/august/">User Experience Week</a> is going to be even better.

One of the most interesting things I heard was that they felt that the last 5 years have been about information architecture and the next 5 years will be about interaction design.  Having done a boat load of interaction design over the past few years, I am now eager to be a part of that conversation.  So much of interaction design right now seems to be based on what "feels right."  There is a lot to be done going forward.
