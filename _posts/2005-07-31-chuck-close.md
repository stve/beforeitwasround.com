<em>"I think the great thing about art is that it is equal-opportunity.... You're not consigned to understanding it or not by position of birth and status and wealth. I am a poor kid from a mill town in the state of Washington, and all the art in the world is available to me as a vast smorgasbord of experiences that is the same as if I were a billionaire. There is a deomcratization of this life experience that I think is very important to me."</em> - Chuck Close

I missed the opening of Chuck's exhibit at the Walker by a few days. As you can see from the picture, they were just putting his name up on the exhibit. Sniff.
