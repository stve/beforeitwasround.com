<p>My name is Steve Agalloco.  I live with my wife and our three children in Charlotte, NC. I'm a yankee transplant living in the south - the weather is nice and the people are too. I am a software engineer working on <a href="https://www.breaker.audio">Breaker</a> - the social podcasting app. Previously I was Co-founder and VP of Enginering at <a href="https://tradier.com">Tradier</a>. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, golfing (when I have a chance), red wine, and the occasional single malt scotch.</p>

<p>A few things you may want to know about me:</p>

<p><strong>How do I pronounce Agalloco?</strong></p>

<p>Uh-gal-uh-co</p>

<p><strong>How do I get in touch with you?</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to get in touch with me is by email at <a
href="mailto:s&#116;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#46;ag&#97;l&#108;&#111;&#99;o&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;i&#108;.&#99;o&#109;">&#115;&#116;&#101;&#118;&#101;.&#97;&#103;&#97;&#108;loc&#111;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What does "before it was round" mean?</strong></p>

<p>Before it was round is a reference to the world pre-Christopher Columbus and the paradigm shift that took place afterwards. Prior to Columbus' discovery of North America, the earth was flat because we believed it to be. Hence: the earth was flat before it was round. I've always enjoyed thinking of things that way. That something is one thing, until something happens and then it isn't anymore. It's a simple way of thinking of the world (and yes, I'm aware that the Vikings likely discovered america well before Columbus).</p>

<p>Did you know that Columbus kept <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/columbus.htm">two logs of the journey</a>?  One with the actual distance calculated, and another to share with his crew. Fascinating. Were you also aware of all the abhorrent things Columbus did to the native islanders he encountered? Columbus' legacy is without question one that should not be celebrated.</p>

<p>For the past 5+ years I have been working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I enjoy contributing to open source software, notable projects include:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tweetstream/tweetstream">TweetStream</a>: I took over as maintainer from <a href="http://www.mbleigh.com/">Michael Bleigh</a> in 2011 and have since added support for OAuth, Site Streams, and many other features.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">Twitter gem</a>: I am a member of the core team responsible for feature development and community support.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stve/tophat">TopHat</a>: TopHat is a gem that I've used on nearly every Rails project I've worked on.  It allows you to easily include Facebook Open Graph and Twitter Card meta content in your Rails apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stve/airbrake-api">Airbrake API</a>: The very first gem I published (when the service was called Hoptoad) for a now-defunkt side-project.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stve/instapaper">Instapaper gem</a>: Instapaper is such a great service and if you are a subscriber you have access to the full API that this gem can interact with.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tweetstream/em-twitter">EM Twitter</a>: Probably the open source project I've logged the most hours on, EM-Twitter is the core behind TweetStream and enables full interaction with Twitter's Streaming API.</p>

<p>I've also contributed to: rails, rubygems, faraday_middleware, jsonpath, octokit, geocoder, rash, homebrew, and <a href="https://github.com/stve">many others</a>.
